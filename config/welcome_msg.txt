Hi there!

Welcome to the AquaQ Analytics Slack workspace! :)

Now that you're here, why not pop over to <#C02FKQANF|general> and say hello? You should also set a profile picture, to help us identify people - pick something fun!

You may also like to join a few of our other public channels, like <#C02FKQANV|random> for non-work related bantering, or <#C8XKR4JGP|public-q-channel> for more specific discussion of KDB+/q

If you have any problems or need any help with anything, don't hesitate to ping <@U8VJ54DMK>
